# Soomi — Minimal Chess Engine (Go)

Soomi is a small, educational chess engine written in Go. It implements core chess-engine techniques (bitboards, negamax search, quiescence, TT, simple evaluation) as a learning project rather than a competitive engine.

## Features
- Bitboard move generation (now magic) 
- Evaluation: material, piece-square tables, mobility, passed pawns; middlegame ↔ endgame interpolation (phase blend)  
- Move ordering: hash move, promotions, MVV-LVA captures, killers  
- Quiescence search with delta pruning 
- Transposition table (TT)  
- Negamax search with alpha-beta, late-move reductions (LMR), razoring, mate-distance pruning  
- UCI loop (works with Arena and other GUIs)  
- Iterative deepening with depth-based aspiration windows  
- Simple time control

## Limitations
- No FEN parsing (input/output limited)  
- No pondering / no multi-threading (single-threaded)  
- Basic move ordering and evaluation (hand-tuned)  
- Intended for learning and experimentation, not overly optimized for strength

## Build & Run
1. Install Go (1.20+ recommended): https://go.dev/doc/install  
2. Into terminal paste either:
3. go build -o Soomi.exe soomi.go (provides normal, about 2500kb)
4. go build -trimpath -ldflags "-s -w" -o Soomi.exe soomi.go (smaller, about 1700 kb)

Any suggestions are welcome on how to improve the engine.
